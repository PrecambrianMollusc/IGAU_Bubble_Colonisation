This is an interactive plot of the survey of the galactic He levels 
initail work in progress

Note there are 3 three.modules js files also added. This is because the modul.js files needed editing to remove "From Three" and replace with from (location below) 
from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.154.0/build/three.module.js';
Those are are hardcoded with the local directory name , so if they get moved to another ropository will likely need some editing.

Note I did name the meshes in the python pyvista code with the intent to use those names here hwwever it didnt 'stick' so the meshes are called mesh0 mesh1 .....
I'll add some annotaions to explain what each one is if I can't get the name to export properly
